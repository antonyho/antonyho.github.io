---------------------------
Hello, my name is Antony Ho. I'm software developer in Hong Kong. I have been a web application developer using J2EE frameworks for years.
I contribute to open-source game server which runs on C# runtime. I worked for online game company and make MMORPG game server and client using C++. I made Android applications for game company.
I build micro-service backend for rapid transaction financial product using Go. And you see how an omnivore I am.
This site is under update and construction. There is not much thing that you can find in here. Check out the My Works pages and find some of my works.
I like open-source software and like using Linux. Arch Linux is my current favourite Linux distro.
