---------------------------
Hello, my name is Antony Ho. I'm software developer from Hong Kong working in Germany. I have been a web application developer using J2EE frameworks for years. And attracted by Go, once it was announced. Then quickly tranformed into Go developer.
I contribute to open-source game server which runs on C# runtime. That was my hobby. And I worked for online game company and make MMORPG game server and client using C++. Used Unity3D to make mobile app games. And also made Android applications for game company.
I built micro-service backend for rapid transaction financial product using Go. And you see how an omnivore I am.
I love open-source softwares and the community. I love using Linux. Arch Linux is my current favourite Linux distro.

This site is under update and construction. There is not much thing that you can find in here. Check out the My Works pages and find some of my technical activities. May be I will also put something my other hobbies here. Coffee, film photography, and retro games.
